  ## Description
  This Project is a functioning blogsite with a rudimentary login system.  By logging in, you can then create, update, and delete your own blog posts, and comment on any blog post.

  #### Installation Instructions
  Clone this to your local machine, and run npm i to get all of the dependencies.  I have node.js installed, and this project uses the npm library.

  ## How to Use
  Once the code is cloned, you'll need to deploy it to a server-hosting site.  On that site you'll need access to an SQL database.
